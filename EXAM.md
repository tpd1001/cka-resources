Things to try out:

Open the Terminal Emulator
Open the Firefox Browser
"Snap" the Terminal to the left side by dragging it to the left center
"Snap" the Firefox to the right side by dragging it to the right center
Open `vim` in the Terminal Emulator
Go to the K8s Docs, search for "deployment"
Copy the example deployment YAML (`Ctrl+c` ) and paste it into the terminal (`Ctrl+Shift+v` ).
Copy&Paste inside the terminal will be `Ctrl+Shift+c` , `Ctrl+Shift+v` and outside the terminal `Ctrl+c` , `Ctrl+v` .
`kubectl create` the deployment
There may be a `Warning: Unsafe Paste` shown when pasting, you can just confirm. You can also deactivate this under `Terminal Preferences->General->Show unsafe paste dialog`


The `~/.vimrc` in the real exams will already have the following config:

```bash
set expandtab
set tabstop=2
set shiftwidth=2
set autoindent
set smartindent
set bg=dark
set nowrap
set paste
```
